## 💡 Recent Projects

### 🧩 Lumbar Spine Classification (Kaggle Competition)
Deep-learning project applying **ResNet-50** to classify degenerative spinal conditions from MRI scans.  
Included an image-selection routine to automatically detect relevant slices, improving efficiency and interpretability.  

**Dataset:** RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Challenge  
**Focus:** Foraminal narrowing & canal stenosis (L4/L5, L5/S1)  
**Model accuracy:** ≈ 85 % (vs. 35 % baseline)

### 🕶️ Vistachic S.L. – Sales Forecasting & Product Analytics (2022–2024)
At **Vistachic S.L.**, I analyzed sales data from retail operations in Spain and France.  
My work focused on **data cleaning, integration, and forecasting** of product demand across multiple markets.  
Using **machine learning and econometric models**, I identified key drivers of sales performance — such as frame type, lens color, and material — and forecasted optimal product mixes for upcoming collections.  
The analyses provided **structured insights for product design and strategic planning**, supporting evidence-based decisions in marketing and logistics.

### ♻️ Ecoembes – Recycling Behavior & Data Analysis (2022–2024)
Joint research project with **Ecoembes** (Spain’s national recycling consortium, supported by Coca-Cola Spain) and **Carlos III University Madrid**.  
Merged **municipal-level recycling and socioeconomic data** (~8 000 municipalities, 400+ variables) to model regional differences in recycling behavior and container misuse (“impropios”).  
Applied **regression and clustering methods** to identify high-risk regions and behavioral patterns.  
Findings linked **poor recycling quality** to **tourism-heavy areas** and **young family households under time stress**, providing **evidence-based recommendations** for policy and behavioral interventions.

### 🏛 Policy Reports & Ministerial Studies

- **BMAS/IAB – RehaPro: Zweiter Zwischenbericht (ca. 2010er Jahre)**  
  Part of the BMAS program “RehaPro.” Provides first quasi-experimental evidence that innovative rehabilitation approaches improve labor-market integration for people with health limitations.

- **BMAS/IAB – LTA IS1: Abschlussbericht (2011)**  
  Evaluates *Leistungen zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben (LTA)*. Finds positive employment effects, especially for qualification-oriented measures, and points to weak program coordination.

- **BMAS/IAB – Neukonzeption der Typisierung im SGB-II-Bereich (2013)**  
  Redesign of the job-center typology as a steering instrument under § SGB II. Regression + cluster analysis of 37 contextual indicators yielded 15 fair regional benchmark types; adopted by BMAS/BA.

- **Lietzmann, T., Schmelzer, P. & Wiemers, J. (Manuskript).** *Does marginal employment promote regular employment for unemployed welfare recipients in Germany?*  
  Based on SGB II panel data (2005–2009). Confirms that late entry into marginal jobs increases transition rates to regular work, while early entry leads to lock-in effects.
