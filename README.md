## 💡 Recent Projects

🧩 Classification of Lumbar Spine Damages (Kaggle Competition)

Deep learning project using **ResNet-50** to classify degenerative lumbar spine conditions from MRI scans.  
Implemented an **image-skipping mechanism** to automatically detect relevant slices, improving efficiency and interpretability.  
The model identifies the presence and severity of **disc herniation (protrusion)** and other degenerative changes.

**Dataset:** RSNA Lumbar Spine Challenge  
**Focus:** Foraminal narrowing and canal stenosis (L4/L5, L5/S1)  
**Model accuracy:** ~85 % (vs. ~35 % baseline)

### 🧭 Evidence-based Policy Evaluation
Development of typologies and causal models for the **BMAS/IAB** to improve transparency and benchmarking of job-center performance.

### 🩺 Health Economics & Digital Prevention
Ongoing training in **Health Economics (IU International University, since 2025)** — focus on the GKV system, budget negotiations, and evaluation of digital prevention programs.

## 📚 Publications & Policy Studies (Selection)

### 🧾 Academic Publications

- **Schmelzer, P., Gundert, S. & Hohendanner, C. (2015).** *Qualifikationsspezifische Übergänge aus befristeter Beschäftigung am Erwerbsanfang – zwischen Screening und Flexibilisierung.*  
  *Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie (KZfSS).*  
  Examines early career transitions from temporary to permanent contracts. Shows that dual vocational graduates have the best chances for internal conversion, while low-qualified workers face persistent precarity.

- **Schmelzer, P. (2012).** *Indirect and Direct Job Mobility in Germany – Consequences of Job Mobility for Subsequent Earnings at the Beginning of the Employment Career.*  
  *European Sociological Review.*  
  Analyzes income effects of direct versus indirect job changes. Finds that unemployment during early careers leads to long-term wage losses of 7–9 %.

- **Schmelzer, P. (2011).** *Unemployment: a trap or stepping stone?*  
  *Acta Sociologica.*  
  Investigates the effects of early-career unemployment in the UK. Concludes that joblessness can be a stepping stone for graduates but acts as a trap for the low-skilled.

- **Schmelzer, P. & Hamjediers, M. (2022).** *Marriage, the Risk of Overeducation, and Selection into Both. Evidence from Germany.*  
  *European Sociological Review.*  
  Explores the link between marital status and overeducation. Marriage reduces overqualification risk for both men and women once selection into marriage is accounted for.

- **Schmelzer, P. & Schneider, S. (2020).** *Consequences of Overeducation among Career Starters in Germany.*  
  *European Sociological Review.*  
  Tests whether overeducation is temporary or permanent. Finds that most mismatched workers remain overqualified for years, especially graduates.

- **Lietzmann, T., Schmelzer, P. & Wiemers, J. (2017).** *Marginal employment for welfare recipients: stepping stone or obstacle?*  
  *LABOUR.*  
  Evaluates whether marginal employment helps welfare recipients integrate into regular jobs. Late entry increases integration chances by 10–20 %, while early entry creates lock-in effects.

 - **Schmelzer, P. (2011).** *Consequences of Job Mobility for the Subsequent Earnings at the Beginning of the Employment Career in Germany and the UK.*  
  *Schmollers Jahrbuch.*  
  Compares Germany and the UK. Direct (voluntary) job mobility improves wages in both countries; unemployment spells cause lasting losses, especially in Germany.

- **Schmelzer, P. (2023).** *Late careers and income dynamics among the elderly: increasing income inequalities in Great Britain?*  
  *Ageing & Society.*  
  Shows that pension reforms and labor-market changes have widened income gaps among older workers, increasing the risk of poverty in lower qualification groups.

- **Raab, M., Ruland, M., Scholz, W., Müller-Siebers, K. & Schmelzer, P. (2008).** *GlobalIndex: A Sociological Approach to Globalization Measurement.*  
  *International Sociology.*  
  Proposes a multidimensional index that captures economic, cultural, and political dimensions of globalization, outperforming one-dimensional economic indicators.

- **Schmelzer, P., Kurz, K. & Schulze, A.** *Einkommensnachteile von Müttern im Vergleich zu kinderlosen Frauen in Deutschland (SOEP 1984–2011).*  
  *Manuskript.*  
  Examines motherhood wage penalties. Finds that long career breaks and part-time return cause wage losses up to 20 %.

- **Schmelzer, P. et al. (2013).** *Varieties of wage mobility in early career in Europe.*  
  *European Sociological Review.*  
  Cross-national comparison across eight countries. Direct mobility yields wage gains; unemployment leads to losses mainly in coordinated market economies.

### 🏛 Policy Reports & Ministerial Studies

- **BMAS/IAB – RehaPro: Zweiter Zwischenbericht (ca. 2010er Jahre)**  
  Part of the BMAS program “RehaPro.” Provides first quasi-experimental evidence that innovative rehabilitation approaches improve labor-market integration for people with health limitations.

- **BMAS/IAB – LTA IS1: Abschlussbericht (2011)**  
  Evaluates *Leistungen zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben (LTA)*. Finds positive employment effects, especially for qualification-oriented measures, and points to weak program coordination.

- **BMAS/IAB – Neukonzeption der Typisierung im SGB-II-Bereich (2013)**  
  Redesign of the job-center typology as a steering instrument under § SGB II. Regression + cluster analysis of 37 contextual indicators yielded 15 fair regional benchmark types; adopted by BMAS/BA.

- **Lietzmann, T., Schmelzer, P. & Wiemers, J. (Manuskript).** *Does marginal employment promote regular employment for unemployed welfare recipients in Germany?*  
  Based on SGB II panel data (2005–2009). Confirms that late entry into marginal jobs increases transition rates to regular work, while early entry leads to lock-in effects.
