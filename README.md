# 👋 Hi, I'm Paul Schmelzer

**Data Scientist | Health Economist | Researcher**

I combine over 20 years of experience in quantitative analysis and policy evaluation with applied machine learning.  
My background bridges **academic research (DIW Berlin, IAB)** and **data-driven projects** in the private sector, focusing on evidence-based decision-making in labor markets, social policy, and health systems.

## 🔬 Research & Policy Background

- **DIW Berlin (2013–2021):** Quantitative research, data management, and evaluation methods in socio-economic studies  
- **IAB (2010–2013):** Empirical evaluation of labor-market programs (BMAS projects, counterfactual methods)  
- **University of Bamberg (2005–2010):** DFG projects on employment, aging, and education — coordination of international research teams  

**Selected government & policy studies:**
- BMAS/IAB – *RehaPro*: Causal impact evaluation of rehabilitation programs  
- BMAS/IAB – *SGB-II Typology*: Regression + Cluster analysis for job-center benchmarking  
- BMAS/IAB – *LTA IS1*: Effects of rehabilitation measures on labor-market integration  
- BMAS/IAB – *Marginal Employment (LABOUR 2017)*: Dynamic PSM; evidence on stepping-stone vs. lock-in effects
